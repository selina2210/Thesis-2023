Thank you for the possibility to contribute in the eIDAS review process. TalTech Information Systems Group has researched and observed
the developments of eIDAS for several years. During this period, we have focused on eIDAS implementation practices, analysis of different
countries and cross-border use of the eIDAS regulation. Based on our experience and research findings, eIDAS is a valuable concept that
definitely strengthens the EU digital single market. Main challenges come from different practices or interpretation. By combining option 1
and option 2, it is possible to significantly improve the current situation and make eIDAS more unambiguous and transparent. According to
the provided documentation, option 3 would result into setting up a parallel scheme to the already existing eID schemes. Therefore, this
option adds complexity to the eIDAS ecosystem and presumes additional funding. Therefore, we recommend to conduct a cost-benefit
analysis regarding this option, in particular, because of the use of the EUid is planned to be voluntary.
