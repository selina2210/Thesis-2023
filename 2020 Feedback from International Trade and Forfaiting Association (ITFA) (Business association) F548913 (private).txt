LEGAL UNCERTAINTY ABOUNDS – EXTRACT FROM 2020 ICC GLOBAL
SURVEY ON TRADE FINANCE

IMPORTANCE TO TRADE (1):
BILLS OF LADING

❑ Bills of Lading underpin most imports – conservatively 90%
❑ Next slide sets out EU import /export data for 2010-2019 in trillion USD
❑ Usage is massive as can be seen
❑ Bills of lading are used in both the physical carriage of goods and their financing
❑ They are therefore an ideal bridge between the two worlds and support real trade
❑ Recent frauds in Singapore show their vulnerability to forgery and misuse

▪ The data presented here are the freight on board (FOB) values for exports (seller costs) and Cost,
Insurance and Freight (CIF) for imports (buyer costs).
▪ Values include insurances, which, according to the Berne Union, represent approximately 10% of world
trade
▪ Since FOB and CIF are the "shipped on board" values of a Bill of Lading, these values are, effectively, the
same as total values as bills of lading (with 10% deductible for insurance potentially)

PROMISSORY NOTES AND BILLS OF EXCHANGE

❑ These instruments underpin
much of the receivables
discounting and forfaiting
industries in Europe and

security to much of the

IMPORTANCE TO TRADE (2):
PROMISSORY NOTES AND BILLS OF EXCHANGE

❑ Bills of exchange and promissory notes are (when in valid paper form) unconditional
and simple payment obligations capable of easy transmission, registration and
potentially listing on an exchange

❑ New investors are interested in these assets as trade is safe and yields more than
cash

❑ Much of this potential market relates to MSME financing
❑ Trade assets are safe, as successive ICC Trade Register results show (0.06% for
trade loans during 2014-2018 for example)

❑ Operationally, such investors are accustomed to bonds, the features of which can be
replicated by notes and bills

IMPORTANCE TO TRADE (3):
USE IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE RULES

❑ International trade rules (UCP 600 and URC 522) published by the ICC are used in
almost all letters of credit (28% of global trade finance for 2018 according to the most
recent ICC Trade Register) and collections respectively

❑ Both sets of rules require the presentation of documents which are in paper form
❑ New electronic versions of these rules permit the presentation of electronic
documentation but, as shown above, the main documents used in trade must, in too
many cases, be paper-based

❑ Allowing these documents to be digitised would ensure success of these rules in the
digital age with enormous attendant operational and financial savings

EIDAS REVIEW
SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS (1) - EIDAS TO DEAL WITH DOCUMENTS

❑ All the above trade instruments must be signed but are subject to other legal challenges as
illustrated above

❑ Article 25 provides for apparent non-discrimination of e-signatures but is of limited effect when
the signed document is ineffective in other than paper form

❑ eIDAS framework could be amended to provide for a general rule that an electronically signed
document should not be denied effect because it is in electronic form

❑ Such an amendment would unburden trade documentation from out of date laws which never
envisaged digital instruments, but which otherwise work well and are used all over Europe
(and have global counterparts)

❑ UK will introduce fast-tracked legislation next year to overcome these issues
❑ Article 7 of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records :“An [electronic
transferable record] shall not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability on the sole
ground that it is in electronic form.” [whole document here]

EIDAS REVIEW
SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS (2) – EIDAS TO FULLY RECOGNISE VALUE OF
SIMPLE ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES (ARTICLE 25 (1))

❑ In case of the commercial documentation referred to above, the simple electronic signature is
sufficient to satisfy legal requirements.

❑ In some EU countries (e.g. Sweden) no qualified trust service provider exist. The need for
speedy transaction times favours simple signatures.

❑ The extra benefits of advanced and qualified signatures are desirable but take-up should be a
commercial decision and simpler options should not be “second-best”.

❑ Article 25(1) could be amended to confirm that a simple electronic signature is sufficient to
denote consent or give agreement. A new subparagraph could be added to say that: “An
electronic signature shall not be deemed incapable of denoting consent or agreement solely
on the grounds that it is in electronic form or that it does not meet the requirements for
qualified electronic signatures.”

EIDAS REVIEW
POLICY PERSPECTIVE - BENEFITS OF THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS (1) & (2)

❑ The digitalisation of commercial documents used in international trade is important for trade
parties as it reduces operational risks and linked costs - the technology exists but the law
needs to catch up

➢ If we can achieve this goal, the documents can be used more widely and become more liquid.
➢ The ultimate beneficiaries are the exporters and other companies involved in supply chain financing.
➢ Thanks to that, supply chain financing can become more affordable for the companies, particularly for
MSMEs.

➢ Consequently, the digitalisation of these documents could be considered a building block to support
MSME financing.

❑ The digitalisation of trade documents would also help making regulatory supervision more
efficient and effective as it facilitates use of digital platforms. This is critical for customs and
other public authorities involved in trade.
