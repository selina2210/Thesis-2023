Hi: thank you for great step forward. Observing various EID schemes so far which the paper categorize them as moderate success but i
have to say it has a long way to go to serve its core purpose which is cross border transactions and ease of business. While 15 member
states have developed their own EID schemes and launched it at various levels in their own countries either in public sector usage or
private sector usage but there is is little to no evidence that there is any motivations for local companies or states to offer authentication on
their own sites/apps. A German citizen living in France will hardly find any local companies offering authentication via German EID. I am
sure same is true for most member states.

Combination of option 2 and 3 seems like a best way to to go but the guideline has to be more direct and possibly prescriptive (perhaps
including form factor) else one of the biggest issue is overlooked which is end user experience which is one of the biggest weakness of
current EID schemes. Another prescription has to give important to higher level of assurance (allowing any guidance where such wallets can
be filled by simply a picture of document can have vey low fraud tolerance).

Allowing private sectors to contribute towards global EID schemes will bring the best out of every thing including building some thing which
is thought with not only business but also end users in mind. The services need to be free for end users where as private IDP providers
shall have some motivation/reward to offer such services in the interest of end users, perhaps monetized through business that offer such
services.
