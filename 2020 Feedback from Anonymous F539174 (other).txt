None of these provide substantial improvements. There are currently several areas requiring urgently addressing.

- Pivot from digital identification to digital verification as in the CEPS report. None of these moves in that direction.

- Standards based electronic identities and component based recognition. Today this is based on auditors subjective assessment and the
cooperation networks whim at whim. It is groundhog day as previously audited components are re-audited unless the same auditor i
chosen. This leads to arbitrage in choosing auditor.

Mostly this is symptomatic of a culture which is non commercial. As such there is not even sufficient test data to implement sensible in
another member state. Introducing market forces would surely help on this, and note should be taken that the successful eid schemes (in
terms of actually being used) are private founded even if some public/private mumbo jumbo has been put on top after the fact.
