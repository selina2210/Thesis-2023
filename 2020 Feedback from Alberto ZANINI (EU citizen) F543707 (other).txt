The "impact assessment" paper advocates that a combination of the "option 2" and "option 3" would be the most effective approach. Albeit
some overarching assumptions should be carefully assessed (e.g. the "stimulus for the public sector to stimulate innovation" and the
"benefits for the private sector that would counterbalance the costs" - in hindsight, some national experiences suggest the opposite), it is
worthy of endorsement.

Perhaps, some cutting edge technologies such as decentralized identity/verifiable claims should have been mentioned, and the "option 1"
could be slightly reinforced introducing the mandatory notification for all MS: this would serve as a basis for a more ambitious step forward
and represent an incremental approach. In other words, the options could also be not mutually exclusive - they could be part of a multiyear program plan where tactical ("option 1") and strategic goals ("2" and/or "3") would meet.
