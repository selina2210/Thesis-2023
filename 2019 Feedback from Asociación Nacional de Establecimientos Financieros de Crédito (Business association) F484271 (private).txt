In relation to the spanish market, it is unfortunate that although the recognized or qualified
signature system implemented in the National Identity Document should have been widely
disseminated, its use however is practically null , in commercial transactions. This is due, on the
one hand, to the need of the citizen to use an electronic reader and, on the other hand, due to
the difficulties imposed by the procedures of the aforementioned signature system.
However, in Spain, the use of the electronic signature has developed significantly in recent years
thanks to other electronic signature systems authorized by the Spanish electronic signature
regulations.
As for cloud signing, a good judicial reception is, in our opinion, not expected in our jurisdiction
since the signature system is configured outside the user's control sphere, providing, for the
execution of the signature, that a code must be sent to the user, which obviously lacks the
necessary security.
