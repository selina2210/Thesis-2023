InfoCert Group welcomed the approval of eIDAS Regulation back in 2014, a fundamental milestone in the creation of an interoperable
Digital Single Market for trust services.
Trust is crucial to build a digital society which is based on the security and protection of both citizens and legal entities; operating in more
than 20 Countries across Europe, providing Qualified Trust Services and e-Identity solutions in a variety of vertical markets, InfoCert enjoys
a privileged point of view on the strengths and weaknesses of the Regulation as weâ€™ve been able to experience the distinctive
implementation approaches adopted by different Member States.
In reviewing eIDAS Regulation, we believe that QTSPs should be able to effortlessly dismiss deprecated technologies and, at the same time,
have the option to adopt more secure, innovative and technologically advanced solutions for identification, signature devices, signature
services and platforms, without having to wait too long for new standards or regulations to become effective.
We underline that the creation of a universal, trustworthy and interoperable eIDAS-based Digital Single Market is directly affected by the
quality and homogeneity of the approaches of Supervisory Bodies and Conformity Assessment Bodies. In harmonizing the approaches, we
need to avoid that bureaucratic and too rigid interpretation prevails, destroying the spaces to do business and opening the market to low compliant, less-secure, less-trustworthy but, at the same time, highly usable solutions.
