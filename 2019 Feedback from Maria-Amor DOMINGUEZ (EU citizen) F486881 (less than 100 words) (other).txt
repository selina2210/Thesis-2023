1. Update including the current IT related regulations such as:
. EN 50600 for Data Centers that appears a little bit confusing on the previous version
. GDPR, that it was not released as such during the implementation of eiDAs

2. Support in sectorial implementation, maybe as an appendix because there are sectors very dependant on safe electronic transactions
(i.e. electronic payment for e-commerce) that are quite far away from the use of the eiDas regulation.

3. Reference to Member States IT related security regulation and standards like the National Security Scheme
