Finnish ministry of Social Affairs and Health thanks fo opportunity to give comments on the eIDAS
regulation revision.

For social and health care sector usage of personal information is very important. Information is
collected during processes and it is distributed to other participants in the process. In this work
identity of the person is crucial for high quality service. Because of high sensitivity of information
identification and authentification is import if there are any eServices related.

In Finland there is the national ID that is used in all sectors. The finnish ID is given to all visitors as well
if they use social and health care services and this ID is used to store information related to them. As
an additional information their original ID can be stored to the records..

In healthcare there is the European definition how to transfer prescriptions and patient records from
Finland to theirs own country. Identities are converted in this process.

Common ID cross member states would make easier to manage patient information from other
member states and people traveling between member states. In Finland we have already cross
sectoral national ID and thus we have good capability of using such ID. However, current ID is
implemented in so many systems already that changing the format or content of the ID has been
estimated to cause several hundreds of millions costs and requiring several years to implement. In
this sector it is difficult to see such big advantages that such costs are justified. With a long enough
transition the change is possible to implement if it is otherwise found important.

In authentification systems there is no social or healthcare specific system but general national
electronic authentification system is used.
