We share the view that the take-up of eIDAS in the private sector as well as in the public domain must be improved. But, for us it is unclear
what the exact impediments for take up in the private sector are. Feedback from private eID issuers include the lack of financial incentives
to open the system free of charge for (foreign) public sector relying parties. Thus, it should be discussed, what the exact problems are and
then how to solve them.

In our view, it is most important to improve the situation as fast as possible. At the same time the investments made by private and public
parties should be protected. While the options 2 and 3 would perhaps improve the situation in far future, many of the goals can certainly be
achieved quite fast by adjustments to the current eIDAS framework, e.g. by clarifying cost-model and the access conditions of private
parties and by making the notification process less complex. Such possible improvements should be taken into account by comparing the
different options.
