prerequisitions:
Digital identity is only one
Authentication (validation of identity) can be done by multiple ID means on different level

EU must give guidelines not only to digital identity and trustworthy services like current eIDAS, but must give guidelines (or directive) to
member states on ID means. It´s not enough to have 1 ID means (national ID card for example). There must be divided between personal
ID means and profesional ID means. Like:
1) I (as a citizen) want to use public service (pay tax) - I will use personal ID means
2) I (as a clerk, healthcare professional, soldier, police officer...) want to use public service (for my work) - I will use profesional ID means

Both leads to 1 digital identity but it´s not recommended to use personal ID means in my proffesion, on the other hand it´s not
recommended to use profesional ID means in personal things.

There can be even restriction - some public services can´t used some ID means - I can´t use Healthcare profesional ID to sell my house
even it leads to same digital identity and it has same LoA as other means.
